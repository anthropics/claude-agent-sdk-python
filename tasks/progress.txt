## Codebase Patterns
- Use FastAPI for webhook servers with signature verification
- All exceptions should use `raise ... from e` pattern for proper exception chaining (ruff B904)
- Use `hmac.compare_digest()` for constant-time signature comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Load configuration from environment variables using a dataclass with `@classmethod from_env()`
- Use explicit type annotations when extracting values from JSON to satisfy mypy (e.g., `token: str = data["token"]`)
- Use httpx.AsyncClient for async HTTP requests
- Use `yaml.safe_load()` for secure YAML parsing (never `yaml.load()` without Loader)
- GitHub Contents API: use `Accept: application/vnd.github.raw+json` to get raw file content
- Webhook handler should fetch config dynamically per request using installation token and head SHA

## 2026-01-24 - US-004
- What was implemented: Review trigger detection to identify when configured AI reviewers are requested
- Files changed:
  - `tasks/ai_pr_reviewer/trigger_detection.py` - ReviewTrigger and TriggerDetectionResult dataclasses, detect_review_triggers() and helper functions
  - `tasks/ai_pr_reviewer/webhook.py` - Updated handle_pull_request_event() to integrate with reviewer config and trigger detection
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GitHub review_requested webhook includes a single `requested_reviewer` object (not a list) for individual requests
  - The webhook handler flow: authenticate -> fetch config -> detect triggers -> return result
  - Use dataclasses with properties (e.g., `has_triggers`) to provide convenient helper methods
  - Separate trigger detection logic from webhook handling for testability and reuse
  - Return structured response with both triggered reviews and ignored reviewers for transparency

## 2026-01-24 - US-003
- What was implemented: Reviewer configuration parser for .ai-reviewer.yml files
- Files changed:
  - `tasks/ai_pr_reviewer/reviewer_config.py` - ReviewerSettings, RepoReviewerConfig dataclasses, parse_reviewer_config() and fetch_reviewer_config() functions
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `yaml.safe_load()` for secure YAML parsing (never use `yaml.load()` without Loader)
  - GitHub Contents API returns raw file content when using `Accept: application/vnd.github.raw+json` header
  - Required types-PyYAML for mypy type checking with PyYAML
  - YAML config structure: `reviewers:` section with username keys mapping to `prompt` (required) and `language` (optional)
  - Custom exceptions (ConfigNotFoundError, ConfigParseError) help distinguish between missing files and invalid content

## 2026-01-24 - US-002
- What was implemented: GitHub App authentication with JWT generation and installation token management
- Files changed:
  - `tasks/ai_pr_reviewer/github_auth.py` - GitHubAppAuth class with JWT generation, installation token retrieval, and caching
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GitHub App JWT requires RS256 algorithm with private key
  - JWT payload needs `iat` (issued at, 60s in past for clock drift), `exp` (expires in 10 min max), `iss` (app ID)
  - Installation tokens are obtained by POSTing to `/app/installations/{id}/access_tokens` with JWT auth
  - GitHub returns token expiration in ISO 8601 format with "Z" suffix (needs conversion to +00:00 for fromisoformat)
  - Use explicit type annotations like `token: str = data["token"]` to satisfy mypy when extracting from JSON response (avoids `Any` return type)
  - PyJWT library's `jwt.encode()` returns a string directly (not bytes in newer versions)
  - Use httpx.AsyncClient for async HTTP requests to GitHub API

## 2026-01-24 - US-001
- What was implemented: GitHub App webhook server with FastAPI
- Files changed:
  - `tasks/ai_pr_reviewer/__init__.py` - Package init
  - `tasks/ai_pr_reviewer/config.py` - AppConfig dataclass for environment-based configuration
  - `tasks/ai_pr_reviewer/webhook.py` - FastAPI server with /webhook and /health endpoints
  - `tasks/ai_pr_reviewer/py.typed` - PEP 561 marker for typed package
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `from e` pattern when re-raising exceptions (ruff B904 check)
  - GitHub webhook signature format is `sha256=<hex_digest>`
  - FastAPI Header() parameters automatically convert header names (X-Hub-Signature-256 -> x_hub_signature_256)
